# nuke-py
This is my public nuke_env with my **gizmos**, **ToolSets**, and **Python commands** that I created. If the gizmos are out of date, please update them by checking in their repositories. 

## Instalation
To install the Nuke environment, please copy the code inside of **menu.py** to your menu.py and the **emTools** folder that you will find in your **.nuke** folder on your machine. 

The path in Windows should be: 'C:\Users\YOURUSER\\.nuke'

If you don't have any previous menu.py or init.py files previously created, please copy them from the nuke_env repository. 

## Feedback
Let me know of any issues at my email: hello@emateofabregas.com :)
